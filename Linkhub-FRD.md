# LinkHub Website: Concept Summary

## Core Purpose
**LinkHub** is a web platform designed for users to create, customize, and share collections of URLs. It allows users to compile multiple links into a single, shareable list with a custom URL.

## Key Features

### List Creation and Management
- Create new URL collections  
- Categorize the list based on importance and relevance  
- Add, edit, and remove URLs within lists  
- View all personal lists in a centralized dashboard  
- Delete entire lists and archive them when no longer needed  
- Retrieve deleted lists from the archive when needed  

### URL Customization
- Choose custom URLs for lists (e.g., `linkhub.com/my-dev-resources`)  
- Automatic URL generation for users who prefer not to create custom names  
- Customize the list names of the URL  
- URLs can be part of more than one collection  

### Sharing Functionality
- Publish lists to make them publicly accessible  
- Easy sharing mechanisms for distributing list links  
- Seamless viewing experience for recipients accessing shared lists  

## Proposed Workflow

### For List Creators
1. Navigate to LinkHub homepage  
2. Click "Create New List" button  
3. Add URLs via an input field along with name and description (optional), with each URL appearing in the list below  
4. Edit or delete URLs as needed  
5. Search URLs by name or tags  
6. Archive the deleted URLs for further reference/use  
7. Customize the list URL or accept an auto-generated one  
8. Publish the list, making it publicly accessible  
9. Copy and share the custom URL  

### For List Recipients
1. Receive a URL (e.g., `linkhub.com/dev-resources`)  
2. Click the link or enter it in a browser  
3. View the complete collection of URLs with their titles and descriptions  
4. Click on any URL in the list to visit that resource  
5. Add needed URL to list  
6. Delete URLs that are not needed  
7. Save the list by a custom name  

## Implementation Priorities
- Core list creation and URL management functionality  
- Custom URL generation system  
- Sharing and accessibility features  
- User dashboard for list management
