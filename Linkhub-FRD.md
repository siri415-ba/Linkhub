# LinkHub Website: Non-Functional Requirements (Revised)

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the non-functional requirements (NFRs) for the LinkHub web platform—a tool for creating, customizing, and sharing collections of URLs. These requirements focus on quality attributes that ensure usability, performance, maintainability, and security, beyond core functional features.

### 1.1 Project Overview
LinkHub is built on a microservices architecture, using GraphQL for APIs, PostgreSQL for storage, and TypeScript and JSON as the standard for UI development. It follows a contract-first design approach, prioritizing accessibility, scalability, and responsiveness.

### 1.2 Target Audience
This document is for software developers, architects, testers, DevOps engineers, product owners, and stakeholders involved in building and maintaining LinkHub.

## 2. Performance

### 2.1 Load Handling
- Support 1,000 daily active users with minimal performance degradation.  
- Sustain 100 concurrent users per second during peak traffic.  
- 95% of API requests must respond within 500ms (normal load) and under 1s during peak load.

### 2.2 Throughput
- Support at least 120 API transactions/second.  
- Database must handle 200 reads/sec and 80 writes/sec.

### 2.3 Latency
- Initial page load: ≤ 2 seconds on broadband (≥10 Mbps).  
- Time to interactive: ≤ 3 seconds.  
- Average GraphQL query resolution time: ≤ 300ms.

## 3. Scalability

### 3.1 Horizontal Scalability
- All services must scale horizontally without code changes.  
- New service instances should be added with zero downtime.

### 3.2 Database Scalability
- PostgreSQL must support sharding/partitioning and read replicas.

### 3.3 Growth Management
- Architecture must accommodate 100% annual growth.  
- Must support 1 million users and 10 million URLs without redesign.

## 4. Availability & Reliability

### 4.1 Availability
- Maintain 99.9% uptime.  
- Planned downtime < 4 hours/quarter.  
- Real-time monitoring with automated alerts.

### 4.2 Reliability
- MTBF: ≥ 720 hours.  
- Automatic failure recovery.  
- Zero data loss during outages.

### 4.3 Fault Tolerance
- Circuit breakers for critical services.  
- Graceful degradation for non-core services.

## 5. Security

### 5.1 Authentication & Authorization
- OAuth 2.0-based login.  
- Role-based access control (RBAC).  
- Session expiration after 24 hours of inactivity.

### 5.2 Data Protection
- TLS 1.3 for all communications.  
- AES encryption at rest for sensitive data.  
- Public/private/password-protected list sharing.

### 5.3 Security Practices
- Comply with OWASP Top 10.  
- Rate limiting and complexity analysis for GraphQL endpoints.  
- GDPR compliance for EU users.  
- Clear data retention policies.

## 6. Usability & Accessibility

### 6.1 Responsiveness
- Fully responsive from 320px to 2560px screens.  
- Touch targets ≥ 44×44 px.  
- Works in both portrait and landscape on mobile.

### 6.2 Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.  
- Keyboard navigation and screen reader support.  
- High contrast UI options.

### 6.3 Internationalization
- UTF-8 support.  
- RTL language compatibility.  
- Localized date/time formatting.

## 7. Maintainability & DevOps

### 7.1 Contract-First API Design
- Define REST/GraphQL contracts before implementation.  
- Version-controlled API specifications.

### 7.2 Monitoring & Logging
- Health check endpoints per service.  
- Structured logs with severity levels.  
- Distributed tracing.  
- Retain metrics/logs for 90 days.

### 7.3 CI/CD
- Zero-downtime deployments.  
- Rollback capability within 5 minutes.  
- Staging mirrors production environment.  
- Minimum 80% automated test coverage.

## 8. Technology Standards

### 8.1 Frontend
- Built using React.js with TypeScript.  
- JSON used as standard data exchange format.  
- Supports PWA features.  
- Graceful fallback for users with JavaScript disabled.

### 8.2 API Layer
- GraphQL is the standard API layer.  
- API Gateway handles routing, rate limiting, and auth.  
- Prevent N+1 query patterns in resolvers.

### 8.3 Microservices
- Docker for containerization.  
- Kubernetes for orchestration.  
- Asynchronous communication using message queues.  
- One DB/schema per service to enforce separation.

### 8.4 Database
- PostgreSQL with version-controlled schema.  
- Optimized indexes and pooled connections.

## 9. Compliance & Legal

### 9.1 Data Privacy
- Obtain user consent for data collection.  
- Provide export/delete options for personal data.

### 9.2 Content Governance
- Terms of use enforcement.  
- User reporting for abusive content.  
- Automatic flagging of inappropriate URLs.

## 10. Disaster Recovery

### 10.1 Backup & Recovery
- Hourly incremental and daily full backups.  
- RTO: < 4 hours, RPO: < 1 hour.

### 10.2 Business Continuity
- Geographic redundancy for core services.  
- Quarterly failover drills.  
- Manual recovery playbooks maintained.

## 11. Capacity Planning

### 11.1 Resources
- Double resource provisioning vs. expected load.  
- CPU < 70%, memory < 80% under normal ops.  
- 50% storage buffer over forecast.

### 11.2 Networking
- CDN for static assets.  
- Support 100ms service latency.  
- 40% buffer on bandwidth requirements.

## 12. Configuration Management
- Use feature flags for rollout control.
