# LinkHub Website: Non-Functional Requirements (Revised)

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the **non-functional requirements (NFRs)** for the **LinkHub** web platform---a tool for creating, customizing, and sharing collections of URLs. These requirements focus on quality attributes that ensure usability, performance, maintainability, and security, beyond core functional features.

### 1.1 Project Overview

LinkHub is built on a **microservices architecture**, using **GraphQL** for APIs, **PostgreSQL** for storage, and **TypeScript** and **JSON** as the standard for UI development. It follows a **contract-first design** approach, prioritizing accessibility, scalability, and responsiveness.

### 1.2 Target Audience

This document is for software developers, architects, testers, DevOps engineers, product owners, and stakeholders involved in building and maintaining LinkHub.

## 2. Performance

- **Load Handling**
  - Support 1,000 daily active users with minimal performance degradation.
  - Sustain 100 concurrent users per second during peak traffic.
  - 95% of API requests must respond within 500ms (normal load) and under 1s during peak load.

- **Throughput**
  - Support at least 120 API transactions/second.
  - Database must handle 200 reads/sec and 80 writes/sec.

- **Latency**
  - Initial page load: ≤ 2 seconds on broadband (≥10 Mbps).
  - Time to interactive: ≤ 3 seconds.
  - Average GraphQL query resolution time: ≤ 300ms.

## 3. Scalability

- **Horizontal Scalability**
  - All services must scale horizontally without code changes.
  - New service instances should be added with zero downtime.

- **Database Scalability**
  - PostgreSQL must support sharding/partitioning and read replicas.

- **Growth Management**
  - Architecture must accommodate 100% annual growth.
  - Must support 1 million users and 10 million URLs without redesign.

## 4. Availability & Reliability

- **Availability**
  - Maintain 99.9% uptime.
  - Planned downtime < 4 hours/quarter.
  - Real-time monitoring with automated alerts.

- **Reliability**
  - MTBF: ≥ 720 hours.
  - Automatic failure recovery.
  - Zero data loss during outages.

- **Fault Tolerance**
  - Circuit breakers for critical services.
  - Graceful degradation for non-core services.

## 5. Security

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - OAuth 2.0-based login.
  - Role-based access control (RBAC).
  - Session expiration after 24 hours of inactivity.

- **Data Protection**
  - TLS 1.3 for all communications.
  - AES encryption at rest for sensitive data.
  - Public/private/password-protected list sharing.

- **Security Practices**
  - Comply with OWASP Top 10.
  - Rate limiting and complexity analysis for GraphQL endpoints.
  - GDPR compliance for EU users.
  - Clear data retention policies.

## 6. Usability & Accessibility

- **Responsiveness**
  - Fully responsive from 320px to 2560px screens.
  - Touch targets ≥ 44×44 px.
  - Works in both portrait and landscape on mobile.

- **Accessibility**
  - WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.
  - Keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
  - High contrast UI options.

- **Internationalization**
  - UTF-8 support.
  - RTL language compatibility.
  - Localized date/time formatting.

## 7. Maintainability & DevOps

- **Contract-First API Design**
  - Define REST/GraphQL contracts before implementation.
  - Version-controlled API specifications.

- **Monitoring & Logging**
  - Health check endpoints per service.
  - Structured logs with severity levels.
  - Distributed tracing.
  - Retain metrics/logs for 90 days.

- **CI/CD**
  - Zero-downtime deployments.
  - Rollback capability within 5 minutes.
  - Staging mirrors production environment.
  - Minimum 80% automated test coverage.

## 8. Technology Standards

- **Frontend**
  - Built using **React.js** with **TypeScript**.
  - JSON used as standard data exchange format.
  - Supports PWA features.
  - Graceful fallback for users with JavaScript disabled.

- **API Layer**
  - GraphQL is the standard API layer.
  - API Gateway handles routing, rate limiting, and auth.
  - Prevent N+1 query patterns in resolvers.

- **Microservices**
  - Docker for containerization.
  - Kubernetes for orchestration.
  - Asynchronous communication using message queues.
  - One DB/schema per service to enforce separation.

- **Database**
  - PostgreSQL with version-controlled schema.
  - Optimized indexes and pooled connections.

## 9. Compliance & Legal

- **Data Privacy**
  - Obtain user consent for data collection.
  - Provide export/delete options for personal data.

- **Content Governance**
  - Terms of use enforcement.
  - User reporting for abusive content.
  - Automatic flagging of inappropriate URLs.

## 10. Disaster Recovery

- **Backup & Recovery**
  - Hourly incremental and daily full backups.
  - RTO: < 4 hours, RPO: < 1 hour.

- **Business Continuity**
  - Geographic redundancy for core services.
  - Quarterly failover drills.
  - Manual recovery playbooks maintained.

## 11. Capacity Planning

- **Resources**
  - Double resource provisioning vs. expected load.
  - CPU < 70%, memory < 80% under normal ops.
  - 50% storage buffer over forecast.

- **Networking**
  - CDN for static assets.
  - Support 100ms service latency.
  - 40% buffer on bandwidth requirements.

## 12. Configuration Management

- Use **feature flags** for rollout control.
- Store configs externally, separate from code.
- Secure secrets with tools like **Vault**.

## 13. Testability

- Cover **unit, integration, and E2E** test scenarios.
- Simulate production-like loads in test environments.
