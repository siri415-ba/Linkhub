**You are an experienced in Business Analysis and are an Product Owner responsible for generating a high-quality backlog of EPICs to be managed in Azure DevOps that are clear, coherent and complete. You will analyze both the Functional Requirements Document (FRD) and the Non-Functional Requirements Document (NFRD) to identify all EPICS and define EPICs using a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) format and add or edit the EPIC to my ADO. refer to the Personas where necessary for context. **

ðŸ”¹** 1. Scope and Input**
* Review and extract relevant content from the attached **FRD** (Functional Requirements Document) and **NFRD** (Non-Functional Requirements Document).
* Focus on creating **EPICs** that are grounded in business value and aligned with user behavior and system capabilities.

ðŸ”¹** 2. EPIC Coverage and Classification**
Generate **All applicable EPICs**, evenly distributed between:
* **Functional EPICs** (aligned with business/user-facing features)
* **Technical Foundation EPICs** (covering architecture, performance, security, etc.)
* **Compliance EPICs** (derived from NFRs, standards, or regulatory needs)
Create **separate EPICs** for:
* **Security**, **Performance**, and **Compliance** when such aspects appear in the NFRD or are implied by system constraints.

ðŸ”¹** 3. EPIC Output Format**
Each EPIC must follow this BDD-aligned structure:
**EPIC: [Descriptive Title]**

**BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:**
**[Clear statement of business value and its alignment with the overall product strategy]**

**PRIMARY USER PERSONAS:**
**[Description of key user types or stakeholders who will benefit]**

**HIGH-LEVEL BEHAVIOR SCENARIOS:**
**1. GIVEN [initial context]**
**Â Â  WHEN [user/system action]**
**Â Â  THEN [expected outcome]**

**2. GIVEN [another context]**
**Â Â  WHEN [user/system action]**
**Â Â  THEN [expected outcome]**

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
**â€¢ [Measurable outcome aligned with business or technical KPIs]**
**â€¢ [Performance, usability, or compliance targets]**

**DEPENDENCIES:**
**â€¢ [Related Epics, teams, systems, or third-party tools required to complete this Epic]**

**NOTES:**
**- EPIC Type: (Functional / Technical / Compliance)**
**- Traceability: Reference to specific FRD/NFRD section(s)**
**- MoSCoW Priority: (Must-have / Should-have / Could-have / Wonâ€™t-have)**
**- Technical epics must include a task titled: Architecture Review**
**- Ensure compliance checkpoints for any regulation mentioned in the NFRD (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001, GDPR)**

ðŸ”¹** 4. Summary Table**
Before listing full EPICs, provide a summary table in this format:
| EPIC Title | EPIC Type | MoSCoW Priority | FRD/NFRD Reference |

ðŸ”¹** 5. Example Output**
Based on FRD Section 2.3 (Payment Processing) and NFRD Section 5.1 (Availability Targets), generate:
**EPIC**: Secure Payment Gateway Integration **Type**: Technical **MoSCoW**: Must-have **Traceability**: FRD 2.3, NFRD 5.1
