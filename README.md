  Provide users significant control over their link collections through features like creating, editing, categorizing, deleting, and archiving lists. Also allows customization via custom URLs and list names.

- **Provide a Centralized Resource Management Hub**  
  Serve as a central place where users can manage all their curated URL collections through a dedicated dashboard.

- **Facilitate Seamless Sharing and Accessibility**  
  Make sharing simple and ensure recipients have a smooth, straightforward experience viewing the shared link collections.

- **Offer Flexibility in Link Organization**  
  Allow users to categorize lists and include individual URLs in multiple collections.

- **Enable Collaborative List Management (for Recipients)**  
  Allow interaction or personalization with received lists, such as adding/deleting URLs and saving under a custom name.
